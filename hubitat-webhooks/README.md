# Webhooks (Hubitat version)

This is a revision of [this SmartThings app](https://github.com/harperreed/SmartThings-webhook) with some minor updates to accomodate Hubitat. I have not checked to see if the changes I made are compatible with SmartThings, so rather than create a PR, I just made my own fork.

Thanks to Harper Reed for the original SmartApp!
